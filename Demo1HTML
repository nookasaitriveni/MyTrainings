# HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
# Basic Html Structure
```sh
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> Sample Project </title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1> User only sees inside body Element or Tag </h1> 
  </body>
</html>  
````
# For Displaying Text we have different tags
- h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
```sh
<h1> Hello World </h1>
```
- p (paragraph tag)
```sh
<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
```
# What is an Attribute
- Attribute helps to add extra details for a given tag.
- Below achor tag is the sample example where href is the extra tag we added
# Displaying Links using Anchor tag (<a></a>)
- here ``` target="blank" ``` attributeis used to open the link in new tab
```sh
<a href="www.google.com" target="blank"> Google </a>
```
# Displaying images
- src is the source where the image present
- alt is used to display a sample name instead of image, if image is not found
```sh
<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_250,h_250,c_mfit/w_700/sample.jpg' alt='Flowers' />
```
# Generally HTML won't take any extra spaces if you have, it will strip all the extra spaces and shows only one space
- For Example: if "Hello        World" is there then it take this a "Hello world"
- In this case if you want those spaces then we have ```sh <pre></pre>``` tag
```sh
<pre>Hello        World</pre>
```
- this will print as "Hello        World"
# Displaying button in Html and added a sample onclick javascript event, which we will discuss this later
```sh
<button onClick="alert('clicked')"> Click Me! </button>
```
# Commenting in HTML
- To add comments or help text or to comment piece of code use below
```sh
<!-- This sample line is commented and not going to display to the user -->
```
# Displaying this in list format
- This is nothing button showing in Points format or numbers format
- unorderedlist(ul --> showing as points) and orderedlist(ol --> showing as numbers)
```sh
<h1> Unordered List </h1>
    <ul>
       <li>
          line 1
       </li>
       <li>
          line 2
       </li>
       <li>
          line 3
       </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Ordered List </h1>
    <ol>
       <li>
          line 1
       </li>
       <li>
          line 2
       </li>
       <li>
          line 3
       </li>
    </ol>
```
# Adding line break to a text using br tag
```sh
<h1> Hello <br> world </h1>
```
- this will display as below by breaking the 2 words to next line
```sh
Hello
world
```
# Adding Inline Styling to a tag
- style="property:value;"
	
```sh
<h1 style="background-color: antiquewhite; color:tomato; font-size: 50px; font-family:verdana;"> Hello World! </h1>
```
# Note
- Html is not case sensitive but lower case is recommended
- Always try to Use double Quotes (" ")
# This is the Sample Example Explained in Demo 1
```sh
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Test</title>
    </head>
<body style="background-color: antiquewhite;">
    <h1 style='color:tomato;font-size: 50px;'> Hello World! </h1>
    <h3> Hello World! </h3>
    <h6> Hello World! </h6>
